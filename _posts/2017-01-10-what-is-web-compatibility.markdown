One week ago, I’ve started my job as Web Compat Engineer at Mozilla and it’s been wonderful so far! 
It’s a very welcoming place here in Berlin and my team is superb! So, summed up in one GIF?

When people ask me, what I actually do, the conversations mostly go like this… 

**A: “So, Web Compat Engineer? Huh... What do you do exactly?”**  
B: “We make sure, websites work in the same way on every platform.”  
**A: ”So, I can report a bug when I find one?”**  
B: ”Yes, please! Just hop over to [webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com) and let us know, what you’ve found! We’ll help to fix it.”  
**A: “Oh, great. So you can fix my broken website, right?”**  
B: “Well, it depends… Is your bug appearing in one browser, but not another? Then it is a web compact bug and you should totally report it.”

## What is a Web Compat bug? 

If you find a bug on a web site, just ask yourself… Is this happening just in one browser or in all of them? 
**If it’s in more than three common browsers, please report the bug to the website.** They’ll be happy about some good pointers how to reproduce the bug and which system / browser you are running etc, because everyone deserves good bug reports. ;)

**If this is happening in just one or two browsers, this is pretty likely a Web Compat bug, which you should report over at [webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com).** 
This could be e.g. a prefix the website is using, but just for one browser and others are left out. Maybe the prefix isn’t even needed anymore. Or the specs are not implemented in a correct way into the browser. (Specs just say *what* should be implemented, but not *how*). 

Your experience, knowledge and voice is what is the most important thing. Browser vendors need you! Your input. You are the ones building the web, shaping up the web.
